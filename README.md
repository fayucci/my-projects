## [A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/A%20Network%20Analysis%20of%20Game%20of%20Thrones)
Game of Thrones is the hugely popular television series by HBO based on the (also) hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. In this notebook, we will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books. Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books. 
 
## [A New Era of Data Analysis in Baseball](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/A%20New%20Era%20of%20Data%20Analysis%20in%20Baseball)
Statcast is a high-speed, high-accuracy, automated tool developed to analyze player movements 
and athletic abilities in Major League Baseball (MLB), Statcast is a state-of-the-art tracking system that uses high-resolution cameras and radar equipment to measure the precise location and movement of baseballs and baseball players.
In this notebook, we're going to wrangle, analyze, and visualize Statcast data to compare Mr. Judge and another (extremely large) teammate of his.

## [Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Discovery%20of%20Handwashing)
The Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis,looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!
In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.
The alarming number of deaths.
 
## [Exploring 67 years of LEGO](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/Exploring%2067%20years%20of%20LEGO)
Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one). In this project, we will analyze a fascinating dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built!A comprehensive database of lego blocks is provided by [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/). Lego blocks offer an unlimited amount of fun across ages. We explored some interesting trends around colors, parts, and themes.
 
 ## [Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/Exploring%20the%20Bitcoin%20Cryptocurrency%20Market)
  In this project we analyze the data of Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies. Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in the Internet slang).
 
 ## [Generating Keywords for Google Ads](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/Generating%20Keywords%20for%20Google%20Ads)
Imagine working for a digital marketing agency, and the agency is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. They want to test our skills at creating large campaigns for all of their website. We are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. The client says that they want us to generate keywords for the following products: sofas, convertible sofas, love seats, recliners, sofa beds.
The client is generally a low-cost retailer, offering many promotions and discounts. We will need to focus on such keywords. We will also need to move away from luxury keywords and topics, as we are targeting price-sensitive customers.

 
 ## [Mouse_move](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/mouse_move)
 The use case for bivariate kernel density estimate in web analyticsbBy gathering the mouse movements of few users we are able to determine where are the users moving their cursors. To display the heatmap of the cusor location we overlap the bivariate kernel density estimate plot with a screenshot of the studies web page. The data set is simulated.

 
 ## [The GitHub History of the Scala Language](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/The%20GitHub%20History%20of%20the%20Scala%20Language)
 With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists. Scala is also an open source project. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories (who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc) publicly available. We're going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control.
 
 ## [TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game)
 Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like: What are the most extreme game outcomes?, How does the game affect television viewership? How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time? and Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
 
 ## [Word Frequency in Moby Dick](https://github.com/fayucci/my-projects/tree/master/Word%20Frequency%20in%20Moby%20Dick)
 What are the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick and how often do they occur?
In this notebook, we'll scrape the novel Moby Dick from the website [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) using the Python package requests. Then we'll extract words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. Finally, we'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk).
